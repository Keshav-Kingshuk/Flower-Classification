# Flower-Classification
This is a Python ML program that is trained using Logistic Regression & SVM to classify the types of Iris Flowers based on the attributes from a given dataset

The Iris flower dataset is a famous dataset in machine learning and data science. It contains 150 samples of 3 different types of Iris flowers: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. Each sample has 4 attributes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The goal of this project is to build a machine-learning model that can classify Iris flowers into their respective species based on these 4 attributes.
The model is evaluated on a test set of data that was not used to train the model. The accuracy of the model on the test set is 93.33%. This means that the model correctly classifies 96.66% of the flowers in the test set.
